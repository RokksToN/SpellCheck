Program uses Levenshtein Algorithm for measuring difference between two words.
Levenstein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits(insertions,deletions or substitutions).
Two main parts are text and dictionary.Text is delivered or written by user and dictionary can also be selected.
In editor on the left text panel user writes text or loads it. When user is done writting he can check his text.
Program is checking if words in text are present in dictionary, if they are program will mark them green.
If they are not in dictionary(either they dont exist or user made grammar mistake) 
program suggests words on the right panel(that are closest to word written) and marks them yellow.
